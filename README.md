## Nature-Basket
Nature's Basket is an Indian grocery delivery chain of retail stores focused in gourmet food. It has a range of organic food, imported ingredients and exotic foods

# About this project:

<p>
This was an individual construct week project at Masai School.
In this project I have tried to create a clone of the Nature's basket website using React, HTML, JavaScript and Chakra-UI.
This project was built in 5 Days.
